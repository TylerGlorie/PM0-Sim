#PM0-Sim

This program implements a virtual machine (VM) known as the P-machine (PM/0). The P-machine is a stack machine with two memory stores: the “stack,” which is organized as a stack and contains the data to be used by the PM/0 CPU, and the “code,” which is organized as a list and contains the instructions for the VM. The PM/0 CPU has four registers to handle the stack and code segments: The registers are named base pointer (BP), stack pointer (SP), program counter (PC) and instruction register (IR). The machine also has a register file (RF) with sixteen (16) registers (0-15).

The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the PM/0 has 24 instructions and the instruction format is as follows: “OP R L M”
Each instruction contains four components (OP R L M) that are separated by one space.

OP is the operation code.
R refers to a register
L indicates the lexicographical level or a register in arithmetic and logic
instructions.
M depending of the operators it indicates:
	- A number (instructions: LIT, INC).
	- A program address (instructions: JMP, JPC, CAL). - A data address (instructions: LOD, STO)
	- A register in arithmetic and logic instructions. (e.g. ADD R[1], R[2], R[3] )
